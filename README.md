 [ Open Education Cooperative ]
The Open Education Cooperative is the movement for teachers and educators who want to work and teach open. We believe that openness needs cooperation and support from deferent environments. The method is based on cooperation and openness as well as the knowledge exchange and bonds building with the communities which do not operate in education on a daily basis. The project enhances the role of students in school in such a way that they have impact on the materials which they learn from. The teachers will become the ambassadors of openness and democratic education in their environment. The project is hold by education team of Centrum Cyfrowe. We start first workshops for teachers in march 2018. On the end of June we will have first effects of our work. Four new open education resources for mathematic.
In the same time we are working on online course. Right now we are looking for good practices and materials from all over the world.
